## The Place to display all the things!!

This is where all the things I am proud of will eventually be displayed.  Currently there is a small selection here.

### Roadmap:  
   - Build an OK starter Portfolio page
   - Improve it as my skills improve
   - Finish more cool projects to show off
   - Link to the actual cool projects I'm proud of
   - Set up filters for the projects page so they can be viewed by language or technology
